Bayesian-based approach to assess vocabulary of young children.

This is a project from my PhD studies. The model involves:
1) Initial parameterization of existing vocabulary data.
2) During administration, implementation of IRT is conducted to select items that are maximally adjusted to the child's latent ability, with the aim to reduce number of test items needed. 
3) A full, estimated score is computed for each child, by utilising the test scores and the initial parameterization during (1).
