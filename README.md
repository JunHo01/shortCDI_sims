Bayesian-based approach to assess vocabulary of young children

This is a project from my PhD studies. The model involves:
1) initial parameterization of existing vocabulary data.
2) During administration, implementation of IRT is conducted to select the items that is maximally adjusted to the child's latent ability, with the aim to reduce number of test items needed. 
3) A full, estimated score are computed using the test scores and the initial parameterization during (1).
